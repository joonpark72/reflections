When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I don't have access to the local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There may be changes made on remote repository that I don't want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork to Github, clone to local, branch within local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can work on changes independently, which may or may not be ideal...

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    We can always use other version control software or built-in collaboration
    tools.  Keeping track may or may not be easier depending on the amount of
    changes and stages we expect.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    New features or divergent path is needed apart from incremental changes to
    the master branch.
